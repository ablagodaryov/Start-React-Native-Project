# Common

### Splash screen:

##### Android
    Files for android splash should be named by this rules: File-based resource names must contain only lowercase a-z, 0-9, or underscore
    `Can't convert value at index 35 to color: type=0x1`

##### iOS
    In ios go to `images.xassets` right click in right menu -> add new image screen
    after add all screens -> go to project general settings -> App icons & Launch screens -> click on button in Launch image source picker -> choose images -> press migrate -> delete text in Launch screen file picker (need to clean and restart packager and xCode after that)


### React Navigation

**Tab navigator doesn't show tab content when language is RTL:**

Need to set `swipeEnabled: true` for TabNavigator: 
    `TabNavigator({...someRoutes}, { swipeEnabled: true })`
